  * Feedback
       * Feedback played a vital role during the initial stages and testing phase. We were dedicated to listen to everyoneâ€™s ideas without interruption. 
       * We had a built-in feedback review at the end of every meeting at least for 15 minutes to check on what worked according to the plan and what needs to be corrected in 		future.
       * During the testing phase, we tested features developed by other team members and gave feedback to each other. It helped us to identify the bugs.
       * Feedback helped us in identifying the roadblocks, improve and perform better.
  * Courage 


  * Respect
   	* Everyone was respectful of other team members' time and suggestions. 
   	* Team members respected different opinions and suggestions of each other during the process of choosing technology stacks. Everyone respectfully agreed on the 		  technologies that were chosen based on the majority vote and promised to study and gain the required skills for implementing them.
   	* Whenever an unpredicted problem was happening to a team member, everyone was very supportive and respectful and tried to help and solved the issue
